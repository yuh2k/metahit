Description:  Renames contigs based on mapping information.
Appends coverage and optionally taxID from parsing sam line headers.
For taxID renaming, read headers should contain a term like 'tid_1234';
output will be named as 'original tid_1234 cov_45.67' with potentially
multiple coverage entries (if there are multiple sam files) but
only one tid entry based on the highest-coverage sam file.
Designed for metagenome binning evaluation and synthetic read generation.

Usage:  renamebymapping.sh in=contigs.fa out=renamed.fa *.sam

Java Parameters:
-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.
                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will
                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.
-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory
                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.
-da             Disable assertions.
