"""
Simple Hi-C pipeline for generating and manipulating contact matrices.

usage:
    hicstuff [-hv] <command> [<args>...]

options:
    -h, --help                  shows the help
    -v, --version               shows the version

The subcommands are:
    convert         Convert Hi-C data between different formats.
    digest          Digest genome into a list of fragments.
    cutsite         Preprocess fastq files by digesting reads at religation site.
    distancelaw     Analyse and plot distance law.
    filter          Filters Hi-C pairs to exclude spurious events.
    iteralign       Iteratively aligns reads to a reference genome.
    missview        Preview missing Hi-C bins in based on the genome and read length.
    pipeline        Hi-C pipeline to generate contact matrix from fastq files.
    stats           Extract mapping statistics from a hicstuff pipeline log file.
    rebin           Bin the matrix and regenerate files accordingly.
    subsample       Bootstrap subsampling of contacts from a Hi-C map.
    view            Visualize a Hi-C matrix.
