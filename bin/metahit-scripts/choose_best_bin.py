# This script takes in the reassembled_bins.stats file of the binning module and choses the best possible
# case scenerio for each bin. Each bin should have 3 versions of itself: the original bin (.orig), the
# "strict" reassembled bin (.strict), and the "permissive" reassembled bin (permissive). This program
# decides which one of the three is better for each bin. The goal is to have the highest completion, while
# maintaining low contamination. To do so, we compute a "score" for each assembly. SCORE=Compl + (100-Cont)*5
# Note that we put more value into contamination, as its usually better to have lower contamination than
# slightly higher completion. Ambiguities are settled by the N50 score.
